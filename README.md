Hidden Search

This HTML document creates a "Hidden Search" functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML document includes a head section that includes meta information, two stylesheet links, and a body section that contains the HTML elements of the search functionality.

The CSS file styles the search functionality by specifying the font family, background color, and other styles for the HTML elements of the search functionality. The stylesheet also specifies transitions for the input text box and the search button.

The JavaScript file sets up event listeners for the search button. When the search button is clicked, the "active" class is toggled on and off, causing the input text box to expand and the search button to move accordingly. This interaction creates the "Hidden Search" functionality.
